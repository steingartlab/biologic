    ECLab Development Package: C# example project overview
===============================================================================

This example is targeted at the .NET framework from Microsoft.
It uses Windows Forms as a graphical toolkit, and uses the ECLib.dll file to 
make calls to the ECLab Development Package.

It uses threads in the same way as the C++ projects, to pull down data and 
messages from the ECLab API.

The project was prepared on Visual Studio 2012, but could probably be used on
older versions of the Visual Studio suite (although the project file seems 
incompatible).

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Important files:

ECLibDialog.Designer.cs: This file is generated by Visual Studio and contains
    all the UI elements that you can see when launching the example (buttons,
    checkbox, combo boxes, etc.).

ECLibDialog.cs: This file implements all the mechanics of the UI that is 
    declared in ECLibDialog.Designer.cs file. This is where all the calls to
    the ECLab DLL are made, and where all the UI buttons respond to a user 
    action. 

ECLib.cs: 
    This file is the bridge between the C# code and the ECLab DLL. It
    defines all the structures that are exposed by the API in a C# format and
    declares the functions that have to be imported from the DLL.
    
output/*.exe:
    This is the directory where the exe files are pushed after compilation.
